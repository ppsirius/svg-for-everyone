## What is SVG?

---

import CenterLayout from './centerLayout'

<CenterLayout>
  SVG is an XML-based markup language and, can be written and edited in a text editor.

  So theoretically, as opposed to JPG or PNG files, we donâ€™t need any GUI software to create SVG,

  but is better to do this :)

Only visible in presenter mode
