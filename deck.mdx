## What is SVG?

---

import CenterLayout from './centerLayout'

<CenterLayout>
  SVG is an XML-based markup language and, can be written and edited in a text editor.

  So theoretically, as opposed to JPG or PNG files, we don’t need any GUI software to create SVG,

  but is better to do this :)

```

  style={{ width: "60%", height: "50%", backgroundSize: "contain"}}
/>

---

## Rounded Rectangles

<CenterLayout>
In design tools, the same as in CSS, each of the corners of a rectangle can be controlled separately such operation is not possible on a rect element in SVG.

If you create a rectangle with multiple radii applied to its corners, the design tool will generate a path.
</CenterLayout>

---

## Lines

```jsx
 <line x1="100" y1="100" x2="200" y2="200"/>
```

<Image
  src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c1a20727-8124-42c1-afba-f88c46b65d50/line.png"
  style={{ width: "60%", height: "50%", backgroundSize: "contain"}}
/>

---

## Exporting lines

<CenterLayout>
  When it comes to exporting, Illustrator and Figma will export lines as line elements where possible, while Sketch will always compute lines to path elements.
</CenterLayout>

---

## Polylines

<CenterLayout>
  Polyline is a connected series of straight lines.

  Polylines don’t have dedicated tools in the design tools.

  They can be drawn with a Pen tool (in Illustrator and Figma) or with a Vector tool (in Sketch).

  Illustrator and Sketch translate polylines to polyline elements, whilst Figma exports polylines as paths.
</CenterLayout>

---

```jsx
 <polyline points="10,20 10,20 30,10 40,20" />
```

<Image
  src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cee72efa-5e41-4d84-a660-bc101b080472/polyline.png"
  style={{ width: "60%", height: "50%", backgroundSize: "contain"}}
/>

---

## POLYGONS

<CenterLayout>
  The syntax of a polygon element in SVG is actually the same as of a polyline.

  The only difference between the two is that in the polygon the last point on the list is always being connected with the first point to make a polygon a closed shape.
</CenterLayout>

  style={{ width: "60%", height: "50%", backgroundSize: "contain"}}
/>

---

<CenterLayout>
  In SVG, stars are just polygons, there is NO star element.

  It’s important to remember that Star and Polygon tools are used to create regular stars and polygons, while the polygon element in SVG can be used for any polygon, regular or irregular.
</CenterLayout>

---

## PATHS

<CenterLayout>
  In fact, every basic shape can be described as a path element.
</CenterLayout>

```jsx
<path d="M 10,30
        A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30
        A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30
        Q 90,60 50,90
        Q 10,60 10,30 z"/>
```

---

## Why difference shapes matter

<CenterLayout>
  Don’t create rectangles with lines or circles with rectangles if you don’t have a good reason.
</CenterLayout>

* Semantics/Readability

* File Size

* Animations

* Variants/Responsiveness

<Notes>
Semantics/Readability
Compression tools, such as SVGO, give you an option to compute all the basic shapes to path elements. It can save you a few bites but will definitely lower the readability of your code. <path /> syntax is extremely unintuitive, so if your SVG is ever about to be modified in a code editor rather than a design tool, it will be so much easier to understand it if you keep the basic shapes as basic shapes.

File Size
Compressing shapes to paths may help you minify files but it’s not always the case! For example, a rounded rectangle takes much more space as a <path /> than as a <rect />.

Animations
Have you ever tried to animate SVG? It’s a lot of fun — as long as you operate on clean, semantic SVG. With basic shapes, you can easily manipulate such parameters as radius, width, height or position of the point. If you merge your shapes into paths, most of those operations will be much harder to achieve or simply impossible.

Variants/Responsiveness
Remember that SVG is not a static image such as JPG. You can style it, theme it, make it responsive, and so on. Same as with animations, keeping your file well-structured and semantic will definitely help you with any of those tasks.

## viewBox

<CenterLayout>
   You can think of a viewBox as of a virtual canvas in the form of a coordinate system.

   The centre of this coordinate system is placed in the top left corner of the designated area.

   ViewBox doesn’t determine SVG’s size. It just specifies the coordinates of the area in which our SVG is drawn.
</CenterLayout>

---

## width/height vs viewBox

<CenterLayout>
  Width and height are the svg attributes that set the actual width and height of the SVG element.

  On the contrary to viewBox, they should use specified units such as pixels, ems or rems.
</CenterLayout>

<Image
  src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2044e846-84b3-4f72-a1a5-55e788daeada/viewbox-width-height.png"
  style={{ width: "60%", height: "50%", backgroundSize: "contain"}}
/>


---

## viewBox in export

<CenterLayout>
  In Sketch and Figma, all assets will always get a viewBox equal to the dimensions of the exported element and width and height set in pixels, equal to the last two values of the viewBox.

  In Illustrator, all assets have a viewBox, specified the same way as in Sketch and Figma, but no width and height applied.
</CenterLayout>

---


## Groups

<CenterLayout>
   Apart from setting hierarchy, groups are used to apply bulk operations, such as transforms, to multiple elements.

   There’s no significant difference in how groups work across Illustrator, Sketch and Figma and, fortunately, the basic functionality of SVG groups is pretty much the same.
</CenterLayout>

---

## COLOR FILL

<CenterLayout>
  Color fill is the most basic of available fills and is specified with a single plain color (e.g. #3fd8e2). In SVG, this value is put directly in the fill attribute (e.g. fill="#3fd8e2").

  Design tools export color fills with hex values (e.g. #0000ff), although, in SVG, you can also use all the other naming schemes known to CSS, such as color names (e.g. blue), RGB values (e.g. rgb(0,0,255)) or even HSL values (e.g. hsl(240,100%,50%)).
</CenterLayout>

---

## STROKES

<CenterLayout>
  Stroke attribute in SVG, same as fill attribute accepts colors in various formats, e.g. hex, RGB or HSL.

  And similarly to fill, you can control stroke’s opacity with stroke-opacity. Also, same as with fill, strokes can use gradients as their value.

</CenterLayout>

  ```jsx
   <line stroke="black" stroke-dasharray="0 2" stroke-linecap="round"/>
  ```

---

## TEXT

<CenterLayout>
  Luckily for us, SVG plays very nicely with CSS, which means we can use web fonts instead of SVG fonts:
</CenterLayout>

  ```jsx
    <style>
      @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto");
    </style>

    <text x="20" y="50" font-family="Roboto">Text</text>

  ```

---

## Transforms

<CenterLayout>
  In SVG, there are five basic transforms that we can apply to an element:

  * translate

  * scale

  * rotate

  * skew (skewX or skewY)

  * matrix

</CenterLayout>

---

## Transforms tip

<CenterLayout>
  Notice that even though some of the SVG transforms look very similar to CSS transforms, they are not the same.

  For example, CSS offers both 2D and 3D rotation functions while SVG has only one 2D rotate function.

</CenterLayout>

---

<CenterLayout>
  Also, while CSS accepts various angle units such as degrees or radians, SVG rotations are always set in degrees, therefore a unit can be omitted (e.g. rotate(45), NOT ~~rotate(45deg)~~)
</CenterLayout>

  ```jsx
    <g transform="scale(3) rotate(90) translate(50,100)"> … </g>
  ```
---


## Others elements

<CenterLayout>

  * GRADIENT FILL

  * PATTERN/IMAGE FILL

  * BLEND MODES

  * SYMBOLS AND COMPONENTS

  * SHADOWS, FILTERS, OTHER EFFECT

</CenterLayout>
